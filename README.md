# Automated-Segmentation-Campaign
Developed and implemented an automated customer segmentation and SMS campaign engine that delivers targeted, personalized offers to defined customer segments. This solution effectively supports cross-selling and upselling initiatives, reduces churn, strengthens customer retention, and drives incremental sales revenue.
The system utilises a randomised customer database where the telephone number serves as the unique identifier and the customer's age functions as the primary segmentation criterion.
